                    We have a large kitchen in our historic Grade 2 listed home and we wanted our new kitchen to have a traditional 'National Trust' look.  Rhiannon helped us come up with a design that is simultaneously stylish and practical, but rooted in a bygone era - she really understood what we were looking for. She listened to us, and creatively translated our aspirations into design. But she wasn't afraid to challenge us to step out of our comfort zone, and we are so glad we trusted her design instinct. We just love our new kitchen!  It's so right for the house and feels as if it's always been there - you can't get more National Trust than that!
